A repository that holds all kinds of recipers written as programmer code!

## Contributing & HacktoberFest
1 - Fork this repo
2 - Download your fork clicking "Clone" and a version control software, such as the GitHub app or Sourcetree.
3 - Get a recipe that is yours, your nana's or one you have always wanted to try.
3.5 - Make sure we don't have a copy of that recipe for your chosen programming language already.
4 - Create the recipe code. It does not have to compile, but it needs to be readable by that language standards.
5 - Store it in the correct language folder. If it doesn't exit, feel free to create a new one!
6 - Make a PR!
