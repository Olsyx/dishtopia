# Dishtopia
A beginner-friendly repository that holds all kinds of recipes written as programmer code!

## What is this repository about?
The purpose of this repository is not about real world application, but rather learning to structure and flow of code. It is aimed as a challenge to new programmers, where the stakes are none but the benefit could be infinite.

You are given a boilerplate class, called Recipe. We will pretend like it is used somewhere by some program, and implement many versions of it that must theoretically work.

The constraints are:
- Each child of Recipe must represent the steps to preparing a dish. Any dish. Any food.
- This class has an event called OnDone, which is called in the Finish() function. It must always be called when the dish is finished and ready to be served.
- No appliances are provided, but feel free to pretend like they do!
- Want to get even more creative? Scout the recipes and try to come up with an architecture for an appliance that will satisfy most of them as an exercise!
- You are not restricted to one class, either! You may need several recipes to make one big dish, go nuts! (haha pun intended).
- Have fun!

## Programming Languages
The original project was made in C#, but feel free to start a new Recipe class in any other programming language. The only requirement is that it be contained by a folder named with the programming language's name.

## Contributing & HacktoberFest
1. Fork this repo
2. Download your fork clicking "Clone" and a version control software, such as the GitHub app or Sourcetree.
3. Get a recipe that is yours, your nana's or one you have always wanted to try. (Make sure we don't have a copy of that recipe for your chosen programming language already.)
4. Create the recipe code. It does not have to compile, but it needs to be readable by that language standards.
5. Store it in the correct language folder. If it doesn't exit, feel free to create a new one!
6. Make a PR!
